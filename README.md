The basic challenge: to take a hard-to-read stream of data and bring it under
control, in a clean and interactive UI, using DOM manipulation.

Feel inclined to offer a choice: "database" access (of a separate file) or html access. Maybe a set of buttons; or maybe a drop-down menu. Like the idea of the row of buttons, with 108, 44, 64, the actual list
(however many that is) and the Douglas Adams button.

So: first thing is to put the buttons along the top.
